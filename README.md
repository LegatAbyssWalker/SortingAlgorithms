# SortingAlgorithms
A bunch of sorting algorithms that I try to recreate. 

# Types of Algorithms
- [x] Selective Sort
- [ ] Merge Sort
- [ ] Insertion Sort
- [ ] Quick Sort
- [ ] Heap Sort

# Warning
Yes, the code may be horrible, but these are for educational purposes and not meant to be used "professionally."
